I am hoping that you will have some insight into my problems adding spot elevations to model elements within Revit.  I have read your blog post http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/spot-elevation-creation-on-top-of-beam.html (based on a VSTA Macro in Revit 2010) and I have implemented the updated methods for finding a top reference that the Building Coder Samples include.  When I run my code, I am only intermittently successful however.  I am getting one of two errors currently when I try to add the spot elevation to sloping beams.
 
Error 1: Spot Dimension does not lie on its reference.
Error 2: One or more Spot Dimension References are no longer valid.  Spot Dimensions can generally reference only those references which have valid coordinates in the view.

I can get the points on the elements that I want to add the spot elevation, but I think I am not understanding well enough the retrieval of the reference in which the spot elevation is associated. 
 
Do you have any suggestions?  I didnâ€™t want to email the entire API alias since you had covered this topic and least once in the past and once in a sample code update.
